# Base44 Follow-up Questions - Getting Specific Details

Based on the initial response about transactions, we need more specific information. Here are targeted follow-up questions:

## Transaction Behavior - More Specific Questions

1. **I just want to ask - when I call multiple entity operations in sequence like this:**
   ```javascript
   await Soldier.create({ ... });
   await Equipment.create({ ... });
   await ActivityLog.create({ ... });
   ```
   If the Equipment.create() fails, will the Soldier that was already created be rolled back automatically, or will it remain in the database?

2. **I just want to ask - for bulk operations like `bulkCreate()`, if I'm creating 100 records and record #50 fails:**
   - Do records 1-49 get saved?
   - Or does the entire bulk operation fail?
   - What error information is returned?

3. **I just want to ask - is there a way to explicitly wrap multiple operations in a transaction? Something like:**
   ```javascript
   const transaction = await base44.startTransaction();
   try {
     await Soldier.create({ ... }, { transaction });
     await Equipment.create({ ... }, { transaction });
     await transaction.commit();
   } catch (error) {
     await transaction.rollback();
   }
   ```

## Getting Internal Details - Different Approach

4. **I just want to ask - in your actual implementation code (not the SDK), what database are you using?**
   - PostgreSQL? MySQL? MongoDB?
   - What ORM or query builder?
   - This would help me understand transaction capabilities

5. **I just want to ask - can you share a snippet of how entity operations are implemented on your server? For example, what happens when `Soldier.create()` is called?**

6. **I just want to ask - do you have any internal documentation or architecture diagrams about database operations that you could share?**

## Practical Scenarios

7. **I just want to ask - in a real scenario where a soldier is being assigned equipment:**
   ```javascript
   // Create soldier
   const soldier = await Soldier.create({ name: "John" });
   
   // Assign equipment
   await Equipment.update(equipmentId, { soldier_id: soldier.id });
   
   // Log activity
   await ActivityLog.create({ 
     action: "equipment_assigned",
     soldier_id: soldier.id 
   });
   ```
   If the ActivityLog.create() fails, what's the state of the database? Is the equipment still assigned?

8. **I just want to ask - how do you handle race conditions? If two users try to assign the same equipment to different soldiers simultaneously, what happens?**

9. **I just want to ask - are there any hidden fields like `version` or `updated_at` that are used for optimistic locking?**

## Error Details

10. **I just want to ask - what specific error codes or error types are returned when:**
    - A unique constraint is violated?
    - A foreign key constraint fails?
    - A validation error occurs?
    - A concurrent update conflict happens?

11. **I just want to ask - can you show me an example of the full error object structure when an operation fails?**

## Direct Questions About Implementation

12. **I just want to ask - without sharing proprietary code, can you describe:**
    - What happens at the database level when I call create()?
    - Is it a direct INSERT or wrapped in a transaction?
    - Are there any triggers or stored procedures involved?

13. **I just want to ask - for the entities that reference soldiers (Equipment, Weapon, etc.), are foreign key constraints enforced at the database level or application level?**

14. **I just want to ask - if I need transactional consistency for critical operations, what's your recommended pattern using the current SDK?**

## Alternative Information Sources

15. **I just want to ask - are there any:**
    - API logs I can access to see how operations are executed?
    - Debug modes that show SQL queries or database operations?
    - Performance metrics that might hint at transaction behavior?

16. **I just want to ask - have other developers asked about transactions? What solutions or workarounds have you seen them use?**

Note: If direct implementation details can't be shared, understanding the behavior through specific examples would be very helpful for planning our migration.
