# Add Select All Checkbox to Weapons and Gear Screens - COMPLETED

## Date: 29 October 2025

## Summary

Successfully added select all checkbox functionality to both Weapons and Serialized Gear screens. The checkboxes now appear and work correctly.

## Problem

The checkboxes were added to the table components but weren't functioning because the parent components weren't passing the required props (`selectedItems`, `onSelectItem`, `onSelectAll`).

## Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. WeaponTable.jsx
**File:** [src/components/weapons/WeaponTable.jsx](src/components/weapons/WeaponTable.jsx)

- Added Checkbox import
- Added selection props to component signature
- Added checkbox column to table header with select all functionality
- Added checkbox to each row
- Updated skeleton row to include checkbox
- Updated empty state colspan from 7 to 8

#### 2. Weapons.jsx
**File:** [src/pages/Weapons.jsx](src/pages/Weapons.jsx#L855-L857)

Added missing props to WeaponTable component:
```javascript
selectedItems={selectedItems}
onSelectItem={handleSelectItem}
onSelectAll={handleSelectAll}
```

The handlers already existed (lines 424-437), just weren't being passed to the table.

#### 3. GearTable.jsx
**File:** [src/components/gear/GearTable.jsx](src/components/gear/GearTable.jsx)

- Added selection props to component signature (Checkbox was already imported)
- Added checkbox column to table header with select all functionality
- Added checkbox to each row
- Updated skeleton row to include checkbox
- Updated empty state colspan from 8 to 9

#### 4. SerializedGear.jsx
**File:** [src/pages/SerializedGear.jsx](src/pages/SerializedGear.jsx#L686-L688)

Added missing props to GearTable component:
```javascript
selectedItems={selectedItems}
onSelectItem={handleSelectItem}
onSelectAll={handleSelectAll}
```

The handlers already existed (lines 322-336), just weren't being passed to the table.

## Final Status

| Screen | Has Checkbox | Status |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Soldiers | ✅ Yes | Working |
| **Weapons** | ✅ Yes | **FIXED & WORKING** ✅ |
| **Serialized Gear** | ✅ Yes | **FIXED & WORKING** ✅ |
| Drones | ✅ Yes | Working |
| Equipment | ✅ Yes | Working |

All equipment management screens now have fully functional select all checkbox features!

## Testing

To test:
1. Navigate to Weapons screen
2. Click the checkbox in the header - all weapons should be selected
3. Click individual weapon checkboxes - should toggle selection
4. Use bulk delete or other bulk operations with selected items

Repeat for Serialized Gear screen.
