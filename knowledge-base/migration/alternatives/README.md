# Alternative Migration Options

This directory contains documentation for alternative migration paths that were evaluated but not selected as the primary approach.

## Evaluated Alternatives

### 1. [Supabase Migration](supabase-guide.md)
An open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL.

**Pros:**
- Full SQL support
- Row-level security
- Built-in authentication
- Open source

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Less mature ecosystem
- Requires more infrastructure knowledge

### 2. [Standalone Server](standalone-server-plan.md)
A custom Node.js/Express server with MongoDB.

**Pros:**
- Full control over implementation
- Custom optimization possible
- No vendor lock-in

**Cons:**
- Highest implementation effort
- Requires infrastructure management
- Higher operational overhead
- No built-in real-time features

## Why Firebase Was Chosen

After careful evaluation, Firebase was selected because:

1. **Faster Implementation**: Pre-built services reduce development time
2. **Lower Operational Overhead**: Fully managed infrastructure
3. **Better Feature Set**: Real-time sync, offline support, authentication
4. **Proven Scale**: Used by many large applications
5. **Cost Effectiveness**: Competitive pricing for our use case

## Future Considerations

These alternatives remain viable options if:
- Firebase costs become prohibitive
- We need features not available in Firebase
- Data sovereignty requirements change
- We need to migrate away from cloud services
