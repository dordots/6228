# Fix Release Form Email Error

## Date: 30 October 2025

## New Issue: Release Form Email Failing

**Error**: "Activity does not contain soldier information"

**Analysis**:
Looking at the code:
1. [SoldierRelease.jsx:829-838](src/pages/SoldierRelease.jsx#L829-L838) creates an ActivityLog with:
   - `soldier_id` field (at root level)
   - `context.soldierId` field (nested)

2. [forms.js:385](functions/src/forms.js#L385) tries to get `soldierID` from:
   - `activity.details?.soldier_id`

**Root Cause**: Mismatch in field locations:
- Frontend stores: `soldier_id` (root) and `context.soldierId`
- Backend expects: `details.soldier_id`

**Solution**: Updated [forms.js:386-388](functions/src/forms.js#L386-L388) to check multiple locations:
```javascript
const soldierID = activity.details?.soldier_id ||
                  activity.context?.soldierId ||
                  activity.soldier_id;
```

**Deployment**:
The code fix is complete. You need to deploy the functions. Try these commands in order:

Option 1 (specific function):
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:sendReleaseFormByActivity
```

If that fails, Option 2 (all functions):
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**Note**: If deployment fails with permission errors, you may need to:
1. Check that you're logged into the correct Firebase account
2. Verify you have deployment permissions for the project
3. Wait a few minutes and retry (sometimes Firebase has temporary issues)

**After Successful Deployment**:
Test the release form email again - it should now work correctly.

## Update: Fixed Function Calling Issue

**Error #2**: "Soldier ID is required"

**Root Cause**: The `sendReleaseFormByActivity` function was trying to call `exports.generateReleaseForm.run()` which doesn't work correctly for internal function calls between Cloud Functions.

**Solution**:
1. Created a helper function `generateReleaseFormPDF()` at [forms.js:147-229](functions/src/forms.js#L147-L229) that contains the PDF generation logic
2. Updated `generateReleaseForm` to use the helper
3. Updated `sendReleaseFormByActivity` to call the helper directly instead of using `.run()`
4. Also updated to get `unassignedItems` from `activity.context` which is where the frontend stores them

**Next Step**: Deploy the updated functions:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

Then test again. If the soldier still doesn't have an email, you'll need to either:
1. Add an email to the soldier record in the database, OR
2. We can modify the function to skip email sending gracefully

## Update: Email Format Issue

**Issue**: The release form was being sent as a PDF attachment, but it should be sent as an HTML email with the form content.

**Solution**: Updated [forms.js:424-519](functions/src/forms.js#L424-L519) to send a beautifully formatted HTML email that includes:
- Professional styling with proper colors and spacing
- Soldier information table
- Released items list with color-coded styling
- Signature section with lines for signatures and dates
- Footer with generation timestamp

**Changes Made**:
- Removed PDF attachment
- Added full HTML email template with inline CSS
- Includes all soldier info, released items, and signature lines
- Professional layout that looks great in email clients

**Next Step**: Deploy the updated function:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:sendReleaseFormByActivity
```

Or deploy all functions:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## ✅ RESOLVED: Signing Form Email Implementation

Created `sendSigningFormByActivity` function similar to the release form:

**Changes Made**:
1. Created new function `sendSigningFormByActivity` in [forms.js:356-540](functions/src/forms.js#L356-L540)
2. Added Hebrew RTL HTML email template matching the signing form example
3. Updated frontend to call the new function with just `activityId`
4. Exported the function in all necessary files

**Features**:
- Same Hebrew RTL format as release form
- Includes soldier signature image
- Shows newly assigned items in a table
- Professional bilingual layout
- Color-coded sections (green for assigned items)

**Next Step**: Deploy the functions:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

Then rebuild and deploy the frontend:
```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## ✅ RESOLVED: Release Form Email Working Successfully

The release form emails are now working correctly with the Hebrew RTL format!

## Update: Changed to Hebrew RTL Format

**Changes**:
- Updated HTML to use Hebrew (he-IL) locale with RTL direction
- Added Heebo font from Google Fonts for Hebrew text
- Bilingual headers (English + Hebrew)
- Hebrew section titles with English translations
- Items displayed in a professional table format
- Includes soldier signature image if available
- Hebrew date/time formatting
- All styling matches the provided example

**Features**:
- Professional A4 print layout
- Color-coded sections (yellow for released items)
- Signature box that displays the base64 signature image
- Performer name from activity log
- Hebrew and English bilingual throughout

# Previous: Fix SendGrid Email Test Error

## Date: 30 October 2025

## Problem Analysis

The error `Email address is required` occurs when calling the `testSendGrid` function. After reviewing the code:

1. **Frontend Issue**: In [SecuritySettings.jsx:131](src/pages/SecuritySettings.jsx#L131), the function is called with:
   ```javascript
   const response = await testSendGrid({ testEmail });
   ```
   This creates an object with a `testEmail` property.

2. **Backend Expectation**: In [email.js:103](functions/src/email.js#L103), the Firebase function expects:
   ```javascript
   const { email } = data;
   ```
   It's looking for an `email` property, not `testEmail`.

3. **Validation**: At [email.js:104-109](functions/src/email.js#L104-L109), it checks for `email` and throws the error if not found.

## Solution Plan

- [x] Update the frontend to pass `email` instead of `testEmail` to match the backend expectation
- [ ] Test the fix to ensure the email is sent successfully

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix Frontend Parameter
Update [SecuritySettings.jsx:131](src/pages/SecuritySettings.jsx#L131) to pass the correct parameter name that matches the backend.

**Change from:**
```javascript
const response = await testSendGrid({ testEmail });
```

**Change to:**
```javascript
const response = await testSendGrid({ email: testEmail });
```

This simple one-line change will pass the email address with the correct property name that the backend expects.

## New Issues Found

After testing with localhost and hosting URL, discovered two separate issues:

### Issue 1: Localhost Error - "SendGrid API key not configured"
The Firebase function config doesn't have the SendGrid API key set. This needs to be configured with:
```bash
firebase functions:config:set sendgrid.api_key="YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY"
firebase functions:config:set sendgrid.from_email="your-verified@email.com"
```

### Issue 2: Hosting URL Error - "Email address is required" (original error)
The hosted version is still running the old code. The fix needs to be deployed.

## Next Steps

- [x] Deploy the updated frontend code to hosting
- [ ] Configure SendGrid API key in Firebase functions config
- [ ] Test again from both localhost and hosting URL

## Update: Both localhost and hosting now show same error

Good progress! Both environments now show "SendGrid API key not configured", which means:
1. ✅ The code fix was successfully deployed
2. ✅ Both environments are using the updated code
3. ⏳ Need to configure SendGrid API key in Firebase

## Review

**Problem**: The SendGrid test function was failing with "Email address is required" error because of a parameter name mismatch between frontend and backend.

**Root Cause**:
- Frontend was passing `{ testEmail: "value" }`
- Backend expected `{ email: "value" }`

**Solution**: Changed [SecuritySettings.jsx:131](src/pages/SecuritySettings.jsx#L131) from `testSendGrid({ testEmail })` to `testSendGrid({ email: testEmail })`.

**Additional Issues Found**:
1. Hosted version needs deployment with the fix
2. SendGrid API key not configured in Firebase functions config

# Previous: Enhance Drone Sets Export/Import with Component Names

## Date: 29 October 2025

## Problem

The current drone sets export format for the `components` field uses the format:
```
slotName:componentId$slotName2:componentId2
```

This needs to be enhanced to include component names and IDs in a more readable format:
```
slotName: componentName (componentId); slotName2: componentName2 (componentId2)
```

Example:
```
evo_drone: Evo Drone (4507); evo_remote_control: Evo Remote Control (4507)
```

The import functionality also needs to be updated to parse this new format.

## Plan

- [x] 1. Read current export code for drone sets to understand component handling
- [x] 2. Read current import code for drone sets to understand component parsing
- [x] 3. Update export to include component names in format: `slotName: componentName (componentId)`
- [x] 4. Update import to parse the new format with component names
- [x] 5. Test export and import functionality

## Implementation Details

### Current Format
- Export: `slotName:componentId$slotName2:componentId2`
- Example: `evo_drone:4507$evo_remote_control:4508`

### New Format
- Export: `slotName: componentName (componentId); slotName2: componentName2 (componentId2)`
- Example: `evo_drone: Evo Drone (4507); evo_remote_control: Evo Remote Control (4508)`

### Files to Modify
1. [src/pages/DataExport.jsx](src/pages/DataExport.jsx) - Lines 88-100 (component export logic)
2. [src/pages/Import.jsx](src/pages/Import.jsx) - Lines 848-860 (component import parsing)

# Previous: Fix Drone Components Export/Import

## Date: 29 October 2025

## Problem

When exporting drone sets in both admin and division manager roles, the `components` field shows `[object Object]` instead of the actual component serial numbers. This makes the export unusable and import fails.

## Solution

1. Update drone export to serialize components as serial numbers with a delimiter (e.g., `$`)
2. Update drone import to parse the serialized components back into objects

## Plan

- [x] 1. Find and read the drone export code
- [x] 2. Update drone export to serialize components with delimiter
- [x] 3. Update drone import to parse serialized components
- [x] 4. Test export and import functionality

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed drone components export
**File:** [DataExport.jsx](src/pages/DataExport.jsx#L88-L91)

- Updated `convertToCSV` function to handle `components` array specially
- Components are now serialized as component IDs separated by `$` delimiter
- Example: `comp1$comp2$comp3` instead of `[object Object]`

### 2. Fixed drone components import
**File:** [Import.jsx](src/pages/Import.jsx#L848-L858)

- Added parsing logic to detect serialized components string
- Converts `$`-delimited string back to object format: `{ slot1: comp1, slot2: comp2, ... }`
- Maintains backwards compatibility with existing object format

## Review

**Problem**: Drone set exports showed `[object Object]` for components field, making exports unusable.

**Solution**:
- Export: Serialize components array to `component_id1$component_id2$...` format
- Import: Parse the serialized string back to object format with slot keys

**Result**: Drone sets can now be exported and re-imported successfully with proper component data.
