# Fix Drone Components Export/Import

## Date: 29 October 2025

## Problem

When exporting drone sets in both admin and division manager roles, the `components` field shows `[object Object]` instead of the actual component serial numbers. This makes the export unusable and import fails.

## Solution

1. Update drone export to serialize components as serial numbers with a delimiter (e.g., `$`)
2. Update drone import to parse the serialized components back into objects

## Plan

- [x] 1. Find and read the drone export code
- [x] 2. Update drone export to serialize components with delimiter
- [x] 3. Update drone import to parse serialized components
- [x] 4. Test export and import functionality

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed drone components export
**File:** [DataExport.jsx](src/pages/DataExport.jsx#L88-L91)

- Updated `convertToCSV` function to handle `components` array specially
- Components are now serialized as component IDs separated by `$` delimiter
- Example: `comp1$comp2$comp3` instead of `[object Object]`

### 2. Fixed drone components import
**File:** [Import.jsx](src/pages/Import.jsx#L848-L858)

- Added parsing logic to detect serialized components string
- Converts `$`-delimited string back to object format: `{ slot1: comp1, slot2: comp2, ... }`
- Maintains backwards compatibility with existing object format

## Review

**Problem**: Drone set exports showed `[object Object]` for components field, making exports unusable.

**Solution**:
- Export: Serialize components array to `component_id1$component_id2$...` format
- Import: Parse the serialized string back to object format with slot keys

**Result**: Drone sets can now be exported and re-imported successfully with proper component data.
