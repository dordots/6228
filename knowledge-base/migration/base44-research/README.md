# Base44 Platform Research

This directory contains research findings from our investigation of Base44 platform capabilities and limitations that drove the migration decision.

## Research Documents

### üîç [Platform Findings](findings.md)
Comprehensive analysis of Base44 platform behavior including:
- Database capabilities and limitations
- Transaction support analysis
- Performance characteristics
- API limitations

### ‚ùì [Questions & Investigations](questions.md)
Initial questions and investigations about:
- Concurrency handling
- Race condition scenarios
- Data consistency models
- Platform architecture

### ‚ö†Ô∏è [Critical Issues](critical-issues.md)
Key problems identified:
- Lack of proper transaction support
- Race conditions in concurrent updates
- Limited querying capabilities
- Performance bottlenecks

### üìã [Follow-up Questions](followup-questions.md)
Additional investigations based on initial findings:
- Edge cases
- Workaround attempts
- Platform-specific behaviors

### üß™ [Testing Plan](testing-plan.md)
Systematic testing approach to validate findings:
- Concurrency tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Stress testing
- Real-world scenarios

## Key Findings Summary

1. **No True Transactions**: Base44 lacks ACID transaction support
2. **Race Conditions**: Concurrent updates can cause data loss
3. **Limited Queries**: Cannot perform complex queries efficiently
4. **Performance Issues**: Degrades with larger datasets
5. **Workarounds Insufficient**: Available patterns don't fully address issues

## Impact on Migration Decision

These findings directly led to the decision to migrate away from Base44:
- Critical operations (inventory management) require transactions
- Data integrity cannot be guaranteed with current platform
- Performance limitations affect user experience
- Workarounds add unnecessary complexity
