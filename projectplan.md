# Fix React Error #31 in History Page

## Problem
The History page is trying to render objects directly as React children. Activity logs from the backend sometimes have `details` as objects (e.g., `{updates}`, `{items_exported}`, `{message}`) instead of strings, causing React error #31.

## Root Cause
The `processActivityDetails` function in `History.jsx` only handles string details and doesn't convert objects to strings like the `RecentActivity.jsx` component does.

## Plan

### TODO Items
- [ ] Update the `processActivityDetails` function in History.jsx to handle object details
- [ ] Test that the fix works properly
- [ ] Verify no other components are affected

### Implementation Steps

1. **Update processActivityDetails function**
   - Add object handling logic similar to RecentActivity.jsx
   - Convert objects to readable strings
   - Preserve existing signature detection logic
